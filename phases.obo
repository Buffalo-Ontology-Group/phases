def: "A mental disposition towards repeated episodes of abnormally high levels of motivation to engage in a behaviour, acquired as a result of engaging in the behaviour, where the behaviour results in risk or occurrence of serious net harm." []
comment: This entity focuses on abnormal motivation to engage in a behaviour and includes serious net harm as a feature. The reason is to limit the class to things that merit a treatment and public health response. It is a quantitative entity and a fuzzy set because there can be varying thresholds set for degree of harm and strength of motivation. As a result, it is essential to operationalise the term for it to be meaningful.
comment: While 'addiction' is a disposition relating to experience motivation to use a substance, 'substance dependence' refers to 'disposition related to the impaired functioning in the absence of a substance'.

comment: 'Belief about choice over a behaviour' refers to whether a person believes that they are free to choose to perform or not perform a behaviour. This freedom might arise from a lack of opportunity or rules. In constrast, 'belief that a behaviour is compulsary' is specifically about whether there are rules about the behaviour having to occur, and 'belief that a behaviour is forbidden' is about whether there are rules about not performing a behaviour.

Although other MoAs will help bring behaviour about, there has to be a 'behavioural opportunity' for behaviour to occur.\n\nThe term 'facilitates' is used to specify that 'behavioural opportunity' will make the behaviour easier. Higher behavioural opportunity will increase the likelihood of behaviour across situations and people.\n\nThe class 'environmental system' relates to what is found in the physical and social environment (e.g., how many streets are there for you to walk on), while the class 'behavioural opportunity' is about the features of the environment and how they interact with the person (e.g., whether an environment enables a person to take walks).

comment: Behavioural self-regulation of behaviour can be an MoA or outcome depending on how 'behavioural self-regulation of behaviour' is described in an intervention. The Behaviour Change-Intervention Ontology includes the class 'outcome behaviour' (definition: Human behavior that is an intervention outcome.), which would not be an MoA. When an intervention targets behavioural self-regulation of behaviour to achieve an outcome behaviour, the former qualifies as an MoA.

comment: While associative learning is often defined as learning an association between a stimulus and response, the stimulus has to be perceived. Therefore, associative learning is between perceiving or processing information about a stimulus (a mental process) and one or more other mental processes.\n\nThe label 'associative learning' is also used for a behaviour change technique (BCT) in the BCT Taxonomy v1 (Michie et al., 2013). The definition for this BCT reads as follows: 'Present a neutral stimulus jointly with a stimulus that already elicits the behavior repeatedly until the neutral stimulus elicits that behavior.' As indicated by the definition, the BCT is the deliberate presentation of a stimulus, whereas the MoA is a learning process that occurs in the brain.

In contrast, "reduce cue frequency BCT" is concerned with a reduction in the number of times with which the cue is presented.

A mental process is something that occurs in the brain, and that can of itself be conscious, or can give rise to a process that can of itself be conscious or can give rise to behaviour.

[]
comment: A highest level of formal educational qualification achieved that is lower secondary level of education (ISCED 2) which generally pursues the basic programmes of the primary level, although teaching is typically more subject-focused, often employing more specialised teachers who conduct classes in their field of specialisation. Lower secondary education may be either “terminal”(i.e. preparing students for direct entry into working life) and / or “preparatory” (i.e. preparing students for upper secondary education).This level can range from 2 to 6 years of schooling (the mode of OECD countries is 3 years).

comment: A highest level of formal educational qualification achieved that corresponds to the final stage of secondary education in most OECD countries. Instruction is often more organised along subject-matter lines than at ISCED 2 level and teachers typically need to have a higher level, or more subject-specific, qualifications than at ISCED 2. The entrance age to this level is typically 15 or 16 years. There are substantial differences in the typical duration of ISCED 3 programmes both between and within countries, typically ranging from 2 to 5 years of schooling. ISCED 3 may either be “terminal” (i.e. preparing students for direct entry into working life) and/or “preparatory” (i.e. preparing students for tertiary education).

comment: A highest level of formal educational qualification achieved that is reserved for tertiary programmes (ISCED 6) that lead directly to the award of an advanced research qualification. The theoretical duration of these programmes is 3 years full-time in most countries (for a cumulative total of at least 7 years FTE at the tertiary level), although the actual enrolment time is typically longer. The programmes are devoted to advanced study and original research. For a programme to be classified at ISCED 6, it:• requires, for successful completion, the submission of a thesis or dissertation of publishable quality that is the product of original research and represents a significant contribution to knowledge

[]
comment: A highest level of formal educational qualification achieved that is a master's or equivalent level education. Entry into master's (ISCED level 7) programmes preparing for a second or further degree normally requires the successful completion of an ISCED level 6 or 7 programme. Additionally, it may be required to take and succeed in entry examinations. Programmes at ISCED level 7, or Master’s or equivalent level, are often designed to provide participants with advanced academic and/or professional knowledge, skills and competencies, leading to a second degree or equivalent qualification. Programmes at this level may have a substantial research component but do not yet lead to the award of a doctoral qualification. Typically, programmes at this level are theoretically-based but may include practical components and are informed by state of the art research and/or best professional practice. They are traditionally offered by universities and other tertiary educational institutions.

Programmes at ISCED level 8, or doctoral or equivalent level, are designed primarily to lead to an advanced research qualification. Programmes at this ISCED level are devoted to advanced study and original research and are typically offered only by research-oriented tertiary educational institutions such as universities. Doctoral programmes exist in both academic and professional fields.

comment: The term 'change' in behaviour change refers to change from what would have happened in the absence of a causal process. Thus. a process that results in a behaviour (e.g. going to the gym) being maintained when otherwise it would have lapsed is included in the class, as is not taking up smoking as a result of some intervention. behaviour change can refer to individual behaviours (e.g. attending a breast cancer screening appointment) or behaviour patterns (e.g. regular consumption of alcoholic beverages).

comment: More than one impulse can be present at one time. When impulses for competing behaviours exist, the strongest impulse controls the behaviour. Impulses are experienced as subjective urges when they cannot be immediately acted upon either because of competing impulses or inhibitory processes.

comment: This class is a dimension and is differentiated from reflectiveness because a behaviour may be fully intentional but involve little reflective thought, e.g., when driving carelessly. In this class the intention relates to the behaviour itself. If a person intends to do one thing but accidentally does something else it does not count as intentional in this class, e.g., if someone intends to injure someone else and ends up killing them, that would not count as intentionally killing them.

Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay.

Such units play a central role in almost all domains of natural science from particle physics to cosmology. Many scientific laws govern the units in question, employing general terms (such as ‘molecule’ or ‘planet’) referring to the types and subtypes of units, and also to the types and subtypes of the processes through which such units develop and interact. The division of reality into such natural units is at the heart of biological science, as also is the fact that these units may form higher-level units (as cells form multicellular organisms) and that they may also form aggregates of units, for example as cells form portions of tissue and organs form families, herds, breeds, species, and so on. At the same time, the division of certain portions of reality into engineered units (manufactured artifacts) is the basis of modern industrial technology, which rests on the distributed mass production of engineered parts through division of labor and on their assembly into larger, compound units such as cars and laptops. The division of portions of reality into units is one starting point for the phenomenon of counting." xsd:string

This means that two objects – for example the two cells depicted in Figure 3 – may be such that there are material entities crossing their boundaries which belong determinately to neither cell. Something similar obtains in certain cases of conjoined twins (see below)." xsd:string

Material entities with no proper material parts would satisfy these conditions trivially. Candidate examples of types of causal unity for material entities of more complex sorts are as follows (this is not intended to be an exhaustive list):CU1: Causal unity via physical coveringHere the parts in the interior of the unified entity are combined together causally through a common membrane or other physical covering\\.

comment: The definitions of forest can vary greatly, and different classes will be needed to support the major categories. Tree cover alone is not enough to distinguish between forests and plantations. The international definition proposed by the 2010 FAO Forestry Resource Assessment: "land spanning more than 0.5 ha with trees higher than 5 metres and canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ . It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use." - FAO.  2010. Global forest resources assessment 2010, Main report, FAO Forestry Paper 163. Rome.

This conditionality is important, as an entity does not necessarily have to be in an specific environment system at all times.\n\nThe class 'environmental system' relates to what is found in the physical and social environment (e.g., how many streets are there for you to walk on), while the class 'opportunity' is about the features of the environment and how they interact with the person (e.g., whether an environment enables a person to take walks).\n\n'environmental system' includes physical and social aspects of the environment. As all subclasses of 'environmental system' will have physical aspects, a separate subclass for 'physical environmental system' would not capture a unique aspect of its parent class.
comment: In ENVO's alignment with the Basic Formal Ontology, this class is being considered as a subclass of a proposed BFO class "system". The relation "environed_by" is also under development. Roughly, a system which includes a material entity (at least partially) within its site and causally influences that entity may be considered to environ it. Following the completion of this alignment, this class' definition and the definitions of its subclasses will be revised.

def: "A material part of an astronomical body." []
comment: Material parts of astronomical bodies generally have boundaries formed by discontinuities in qualities, composition, or other physical characterisitcs. These boundaries are sometimes sharp, and sometimes diffuse, with different classification systems and communities declaring varying thresholds (e.g. for where a shoreline, forest, or other entity begins and ends). However, some boundaries are declared by fiat - that is, by arbitrary human convention or decree - particularly by regulatory or other authorities and communities of practice. The classes in this hierarchy attempt to offer generalisable definitions that allow multiple classfiication systems to map to and interoperate through. If desired, we can create classes that declare thresholds used by a given authority or community under the more generic ones, annotated with source information.

In some cases, oceans themselves are considered landforms. Here, we have provided subclasses to resolve this ambiguity, but place oceans and other water bodies elsewhere.In later revisions, this hiearchy is likely to be reordered based on the formation processes of the entities within it.

comment: Appraisals are a part of emotion processes, representing how a triggering stimulus is relevant to oneself. Appraisal captures the ‘aboutness’ of an emotion process.\n\nFor instance, a stimulus (the image of a tiger) can produce different emotion processes depending on how the relevance of this stimulus is evaluated. The image of a tiger on TV would not be evaluated as dangerous. However, the image of a tiger two meters away from a person would be relevant to a person in terms of its dangerousness. Therefore, the appraisal of the dangerousness of the tiger would be part of the emotion process 'fear'.\n\nThere is no intended sequence of the entities that are part of the emotion process (e.g., an appraisal does not necessarily precede a physiological process part of the emotion process).

For example, a stimulus such as an image of a tiger can produce different emotion processes depending on how the relevance of this stimulus is evaluated. If the image of a tiger was on TV, this would likely not be evaluated as dangerous. However, an image of a tiger two meters away from a person would be relevant to a person in terms of its dangerousness. Therefore, an appraisal of the dangerouness of the tiger would be part of the emotion process 'fear'.
comment: There is no rigid sequence of the entities that are part of the emotion process -- an appraisal does not necessarily precede a physiological process part of the emotion process.

comment: Here `phenomenologically similar' means inter alia: (1) that the experience is `of' or is `targeted towards' some region R of the body of S, so that all pain is in this sense (and however diffusely) localized; (2) that the experience involves a dimension of unpleasantness which -- as is shown by the case of pain asymbolia -- is not necessarily of the sort that involves suffering or aversion on the part of the subject S.

The current placement as material is therefore temporary, in order to move forward with development. Here is the entire email summary, on which the definition is based:\n\n1) there are organization_member_roles (president, treasurer, branch\neditor), with individual persons as bearers\n\n2) there are organization_roles (employer, owner, vendor, patent holder)\n\n3) an organization has a charter / rules / bylaws, which specify what roles\nthere are, how they should be realized, and how to modify the\ncharter/rules/bylaws themselves.\n\nIt is debatable what the organization itself is (some kind of dependent\ncontinuant or an aggregate of people). This also determines who/what the\nbearer of organization_roles' are. My personal favorite is still to define\norganization as a kind of 'legal entity', but thinking it through leads to\nall kinds of questions that are clearly outside the scope of OBI.\n\nInterestingly enough, it does not seem to matter much where we place\norganization itself, as long as we can subclass it (University, Corporation,\nGovernment Agency, Hospital), instantiate it (Affymetrix, NCBI, NIH, ISO,\nW3C, University of Oklahoma), and have it play roles.\n\nThis leads to my proposal: We define organization through the statements 1 -\n3 above, but without an 'is a' statement for now. We can leave it in its\ncurrent place in the is_a hierarchy (material entity) or move it up to\n'continuant'. We leave further clarifications to BFO, and close this issue\nfor now." xsd:string

comment: A household is a person of group of people that live in the same dwelling. A dwelling is a self-contained unit of accommodation where all of the rooms are behind a single door that only the household can use.

comment: Note that it is not possible in OWL 2, at least that we have yet found, to say that the housing unit in which the process occurs is the same one that is the bearer of the residence function (that the process realizes).

Regardless, that act of summarizing any results as a finding statement is considered part of the study.\n\n\n'Study' here is broadly considered to include any defined activity performed to address a scientific question or generate a scientific hypothesis.  It covers scientific inquiry at different scales of complexity, from a single assay, experiment or observation, to a complex research investigation addressing a broader scientific question.   Studies can be based on a broad range of methods, including in silico algorithms, in vitro or in vivo experimentation on model systems, clinical studies on human subjects, or curation and analysis of existing knowledge, e.g. from publications, datasets, or knowledegbases, to derive novel insight.

comment: The formal definition for this definition does not include the influence of the environment on anatomical structure, as the class was reused from the Uber-anatomy ontology. This ontology defines anatomical structure for all organisms, including those whose anatomical structure might not be directly influenced by an interaction between genes and the environment.\n\nAn example for this class serving as a mechanism of action would be in an intervention that targets change in anatomical structure. For instance, a gastric bypass surgery can change the structure of the stomach and intestines, and thereby change eating behaviours.

comment: Note that this relation was previously called "inheres in", but was changed to be called "characteristic of" because BFO2 uses "inheres in" in a more restricted fashion. This relation differs from BFO2:inheres_in in two respects: (1) it does not impose a range constraint, and thus it allows qualities of processes, as well as of information entities, whereas BFO2 restricts inheres_in to only apply to independent continuants (2) it is declared functional, i.e. something can only be a characteristic of one thing.

It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative?\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string
