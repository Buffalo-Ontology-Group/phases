comment: The class human behaviour [BCIO:042000] has been made obsolete. If you want to refer to the behaviour of an individual, refer to individual human behaviour . If you want to refer to the behaviour of a group, refer to population behaviour.\n\nStriated muscles referred to in the definition do not ordinarily involve cardiac muscles.\n\nBehaviours are usually in response to an internal or external stimuli.\n\nEvery behaviour is associated with mental processes, but not every mental process is associated with behaviour. For instance, a verbal communication behaviour will involve mental processes to produce speech. However, mental processes associated with listening can occur without a person performing a behaviour.\n\n'behaviours' can involve a series of activities (e.g., more granular behaviours).\n\n'A 'striated muscle' can defined as 'a type of contractile tissue that is marked by transverse striations

comment: There are complex sets of processes involved in the realisation of human life functions, only some which would behaviours. An example for a human life function that is not a behaviour function: human thermoregulation via sweating function. However, some behaviours can fulfil 'human life functions'.\n\nThe term 'survive' refers to continuing one's existence (e.g., staying alive), while 'thrive' includes a wide range of processes that improve an animal's life, including physical and mental wellbeing and experiencing positive social interactions, as well as being able to reproduce. Many processes can contribute to a human surviving and thriving.

Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay. Clear examples of boundaries of processes are almost always of the fiat sort (midnight, a time of death as declared in an operating theater or on a death certificate, the initiation of a state of war)" xsd:string

def: "A biological process is the execution of a genetically-encoded biological module or program. It consists of all the steps required to achieve the specific biological objective of the module.

comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this.

comment: Solitude is most often linked to low levels of loneliness and positive emotions when it is chosen solitude (due to enjoying solitude) and spent in active ways; people with a propensity to ruminate and those who choose solitude because they do not like being with others tend to suffer the most in solitude - Julie
comment: What are the different motivations that explain why some seek solitude? Here there are so many overlapping terms (ie., unsociability, preference for solitude, avoidance, social anhedonia, affinity for solitude, affinity for aloneness, aversion to aloneness, autonomous solitude, not self-motivated solitude), but I have a recent study suggesting that the constructs tend to load into three larger factors: shyness, affinity for solitude, and social detachment.

comment: Note that this relation was previously called "inheres in", but was changed to be called "characteristic of" because BFO2 uses "inheres in" in a more restricted fashion. This relation differs from BFO2:inheres_in in two respects: (1) it does not impose a range constraint, and thus it allows qualities of processes, as well as of information entities, whereas BFO2 restricts inheres_in to only apply to independent continuants (2) it is declared functional, i.e. something can only be a characteristic of one thing.

def: "relation that links two events, processes, states, or objects such that one event, process, state, or object (a cause) contributes to the production of another event, process, state, or object (an effect) where the cause is partly or wholly responsible for the effect, and the effect is partly or wholly dependent on the cause."

property_value: IAO:0000116 "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative?\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string
