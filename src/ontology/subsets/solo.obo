Thus there is here no counterpart of ‘object’. In BFO 1.0 ‘process’ served as such a counterpart. In BFO 2.0 ‘process’ is, rather, the occurrent counterpart of ‘material entity’. Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay.

def: "A biological process is the execution of a genetically-encoded biological module or program. It consists of all the steps required to achieve the specific biological objective of the module.

comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this.

comment: Solitude is most often linked to low levels of loneliness and positive emotions when it is chosen solitude (due to enjoying solitude) and spent in active ways; people with a propensity to ruminate and those who choose solitude because they do not like being with others tend to suffer the most in solitude - Julie
comment: What are the different motivations that explain why some seek solitude? Here there are so many overlapping terms (ie., unsociability, preference for solitude, avoidance, social anhedonia, affinity for solitude, affinity for aloneness, aversion to aloneness, autonomous solitude, not self-motivated solitude), but I have a recent study suggesting that the constructs tend to load into three larger factors: shyness, affinity for solitude, and social detachment.
